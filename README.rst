Peer to Peer Sharing for physical objects
-----------------------------------------

What's this thing for?
======================

The grand plan
--------------
The grand plan is to establish an open platform for sharing unneeded goods.
Think of it like Freecycle2.0.

The short term plan
-------------------

The immediate plan is to create a quick and dirty Django app that:

 * Enables users to enter information about items they wish to give away
 * Serves up that information to the web, marked up using open formats
   such as hListing

Longer term plans
-----------------
 * Enable users to aggregate and search other users' listings
 * Allow users to specify privacy settings for searches
 * Geographical searches
 * Think about integrating it into users' social graphs (ie. f***book)
 * Think further about how users will contact each other once one of them has
   identified something they want
 * Wanted listings
 * Other implementations

Status
======

I just created a repo, and have started writing this README. That's about as far
as I've got.
