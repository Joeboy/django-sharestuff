Here are some brief installation notes. I'm not going to write exhaustive
installation docs yet because I doubt anybody else is going to want to install
it for the time being, but feel free to get in touch if you need to.

virtualenv sharestuffve
cd sharestuffve
. bin/activate
Check out project
pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration (unless a 0.8 has been released)
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/facebook/python-sdk.git
Copy localsettings.py.dist to localsettings.py
Edit localsettings.py
aptitude install postgresql-8.4-postgis
su postgres -c "sh geo/create_template_postgis-debian.sh"
su postgres -c "createdb -T template_postgis sharestuff"
su postgres -c "psql -d sharestuff -c \"CREATE USER sharestuff WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';\""
su postgres -c "psql -d sharestuff -c \"GRANT ALL ON DATABASE sharestuff TO sharestuff;\""
