Here are some brief installation notes. I'm not going to write exhaustive
installation docs yet because I doubt anybody else is going to want to install
it for the time being, but feel free to get in touch if you need to.

Check out project
Install python dependencies from requirements.txt
Copy localsettings.py.dist to localsettings.py
Edit localsettings.py
aptitude install postgresql-8.4-postgis
su postgres -c "sh geo/create_template_postgis-debian.sh"
su postgres -c "createdb -T template_postgis sharestuff"
su postgres -c "psql -d sharestuff -c \"CREATE USER sharestuff WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';\""
su postgres -c "psql -d sharestuff -c \"GRANT ALL ON DATABASE sharestuff TO sharestuff;\""
